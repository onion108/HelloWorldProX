# Hello World Pro X

**Hello World Pro X** is an application that provides a cross-platform and easy-to-use way to write an ASCII string that contains 13 characters (`"Hello, World!\n"`) to the standard output provided by the operating system using the C++ programming language.

This application uses a technology called C++ standard library to make it cross-platform and safe. And the spirit of **object oriented programming** makes its source code easy-to-read and easy-to-edit.

## Dependencies

You need at least a working C++ compiler that supports C++14 or above, and `cmake` to run the build script.

An example to build this on UNIX platform:
```
mkdir dist
cd dist
cmake ..
```
